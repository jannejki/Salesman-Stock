# Salesman Stock
 Object oriented programming in IoT Devices

This was a project I made for object oriented programming in IoT Devices -course. Language that was used in this project is C++. 

The goal was to write  a program that a travelling salesman can use to keep track of items he has for sale. Each item that he
has for sale is recorded using this program. The program stores following information about each item:
• Name of item
• Price of item
• Number of items he has for sale
• Number of items sold so far
The program uses an array of records to hold the salesman’s stock of item.
The program must have (at least) following commands:
1. Initialize (clear stock listing)
2. Save stock listing to file
3. Read stock listing from file
4. Add a new item to list
5. Sell an item (decrease items for sale & increase number of sold items)
6. Replenish stock (increase items for sale)
7. Print a report which lists all items in the stock and in the end prints total revenue (total amount of
money received from selling items).
